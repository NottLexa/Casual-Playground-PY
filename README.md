# Casual Playground on Python 3 is discontinued for performance reasons, SEE [CURRENT CASUAL PLAYGROUND REPOSITORY](https://github.com/NottLexa/Casual-Playground).
## You can browse this repository for earliest game builds (see develop/notlexa branch), but this version of Casual Playground won't get any new updates.
